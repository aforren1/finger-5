## Capitalization
Functions will be CamelCase to match Psychtoolbox.
Variables will be under_scored, with an underscore separating words.

## File Organization

The abstract class for experiments, as well as all classes implementing experiments, can be found
in the `matlab/experiments` directory.

Any of my classes start with `Blam`, to better differentiate from Psychtoolbox functions/classes.
